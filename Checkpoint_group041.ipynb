    "# Background\n",
    "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 696,000 deaths in 2020 alone.\n",
    " [1]. It is a disease that, if remedied proactively early, can be treated and/or alleviated. Hence, in order to best\n",
    " address the prominence of heart disease in the US, we must use leading technologies to help understand, predict, and\n",
    " detect indicators of heart disease in patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technology of machine learning is already widely used in the field of medicine, including the domain of disease\n",
    "prediction & classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using patient information such as MRI scans, biomarkers, and numerical data about the patient, researchers have\n",
    "been able to develop a random forest classifier that predicts Alzheimer's Disease in its early stages up to an 85%\n",
    "accuracy [2]. The implications of this research are proactive care for those who are predicted to develop Alzheimer's\n",
    "disease.\n",
    "2. Using feature selection and data cleaning techniques, researchers have been able to leverage to use of different\n",
    "machine learning models on multiple sources of data (meterological, epidemic, media data, etc.) to analyze, predict,\n",
    "and prevent the spread of infectious diseases [3].\n",
    "3. Finally, within the space of heart disease classification, researchers have already developed machine learning\n",
    "and deep learning models to predict heart disease. Using a Heart Disease dataset from UCI, researchers have been able\n",
    "to leverage deep learning techniques to achieve a 94% accuracy in predicting heart disease [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated in the previous research that has been done in this field, many different models and data science\n",
    "techniques have been employed in the objective of disease classification. It's important that we understand how we can\n",
    "use the leading technology of machine learning to best predict and classify health conditions, like heart disease,\n",
    "in order to promote healthy habits and preventative measure for those who are at risk. This facet of understanding\n",
    "motivates the purpose of our project.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are trying to find the strengths, weaknesses, and applications of the following supervised\n",
    "machine learning models: Gaussian Process Classification, Support Vector Classification, Decision Trees,\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors, MLP Classification, and Polynomial Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of us has picked one of the aforementioned supervised machine learning models. With that model, each of us will\n",
    "make a hypothesis about the model's performance on our dataset, train the model, and then analyze the model's\n",
    "performance on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test our models, we are using a Dataset containing health-related features for over 300,000 subjects, and a column\n",
    "specifying whether that subject has Heart Disease or not. Our models will be tasked with predicting Heart Disease given\n",
    "the other features, the performance of which will be used to measure the accuracy of our hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we work with the data, we will perform EDA to look for oddities and important information in our dataset.\n",
    "Although we expect that all features in our dataset are somewhat relevant, there is a chance that some features\n",
    "are not worth including the dataset. We will use a mixture of automated feature selection and common sense to choose\n",
    "which (if any) features are excluded. Additionally, we may choose to perform feature extraction on the data, and create\n",
    "more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to hypothesize the performance of a model, we will be taking into account the size of the dataset, the\n",
    "difficulty of the prediction task (Predicting Heart Disease on a dataset of various health related metrics for\n",
    "subjects), the number of and types of features, and the shape/distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will train our model on the data. Each of us will use the same preprocessed data before giving them to\n",
    "our models, so that the models are easier to compare, although some models may use additional preprocessing on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will measure the performance of the model using F1, Precision, and Accuracy scores on the training and testing'\n",
    "datasets. Using that knowledge, we will attempt to figure out how and why our model's performance deviated from our\n",
    "expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will attempt to merge our models into an ensemble, and see if we can best the performance of each of our\n",
    "individual models using this method."

    "### Gaussian Process Classification\n",
    "*By Will Sumerfield*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that GPC models perform very well on datasets with a good spread over the dataspace, and that our dataset is very\n",
    "large, I predict that the Gaussian Process Classifier model will perform very well, if I can find a good kernel\n",
    "function for the data. However, I expect that this will be a very difficult process, given that there are many\n",
    "columns of our data.\n",

    "Additionally, I may need to use smaller subsamples of the data to train the GPC, given that GPCs take up **$$O(n^2)$$**\n",
    "space, and take the same training time. I expect this model to be among, if not the best model we employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Classification\n",
    "*By Miguel Monares*\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) are effective in high dimensional spaces. Given that our data has decent number of features, we can expect these features to be a positive attribute for the SVM's performance on the dataset. The performance of the SVM works well when the data is mostly separable, but doesn't perform well when the dataset is overlapping. Hence, we can expect that heart disease classification performance of the SVM will depend heavily on whether the features can be effectively separated. It will be important that we use an appropriate kernel in order to get the best performance from this model.\n",

However, in order to maximize our performance, we need to make sure that decision tree doesn't overfit to the data, which we can influence by controlling pruning and max-depth. I expect this model will be able to find underlying connection between the features in our data, but will not be among the best."

    "\n",
    "The first metric we will use is **Recall/Sensitivity** (formula shown below). We will use this metric to assess\n",
    "performance of our task because recall measures the model's ability to classify the true positives in its predictions.\n",
    "This is relevant to the problem we are solving because we want our model to miss as few truly heart disease-prone\n",
    "individuals as possible. It is very expensive to miss a true positive (miss a heart disease prone patient) in this\n",
    "context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second metric we will consider is **Precision** (formula shown below). We will use this metric to measure the\n",
    "performance of our model because it tells us how many predicted positives are actually positive. In the context of\n",
    "our problem, this metric answers the question: How many patients predicted to have heart disease actually had heart\n",
    "disease? Recall is a measure that can benefit from biasing predictions toward all true, so we use Precision to ensure\n",
    "that our model is still making balanced and accurate predictions.\n",

    "![Precision and Recall](assets/PrecisionRecall_formula.png)\n",

SVM is able to model the quadratic, sine, and polynomial curve relatively well, but does not perform well on the wave and mixture functions. We predict this is due to the overlapping patterns of the data present in both curves.\n",

It operatres by predicting the mean for each of its splits in the function, which doesn't perform well given the continuous nature of each function. As a result, the regression performance isn't as strong as other models, but we may find better, interpretable performance when using the model in our heart-disease classification problem.\n",
